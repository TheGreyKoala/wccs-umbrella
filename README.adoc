= WCCS Umbrella

This umbrella project of the Web Content Classification System creates a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used to run the system.
The `Dockerfile` of each service, their assets and the `docker-compose.yml` file will be packaged in a zip file.
See my https://github.com/TheGreyKoala/masters-thesis[master's thesis] for more information about the Web Content Classification System.
